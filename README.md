# Uncovering the Patterns: Exploring the Causes of Absenteeism 

## Description 

The manager of a company has identified a decline in team performance. Upon investigation, it has become evident that absenteeism is the underlying issue. Further analysis is required to determine effective strategies for mitigating absenteeism and restoring optimal team productivity. <br> 

## Features 

We used powerBi to explore the given dataset to uncover relationships between the rate of absenteeism and work related factors or employee related factors and then created an interactive dashboard. DAX was also used to create new features to pinpoint correctly the possible reasons for the increased rates of absenteeism and if the increased rates had a particular trend. <br> 

## Tools Used

* PowerBi
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Result 

After proper analysis, a dashboard was built by the team which cab be seen below:
