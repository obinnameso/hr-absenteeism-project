# Uncovering the Patterns: Exploring the Causes of Absenteeism 

## Description 

The manager of a company has identified a decline in team performance. Upon investigation, it has become evident that absenteeism is the underlying issue. Further analysis is required to determine effective strategies for mitigating absenteeism and restoring optimal team productivity. <br> 

## Features 

We used powerBi to explore the given dataset to uncover relationships between the rate of absenteeism and work related factors or employee related factors and then created an interactive dashboard. DAX was also used to create new features to pinpoint correctly the possible reasons for the increased rates of absenteeism and if the increased rates had a particular trend. <br> 

## Tools Used

* PowerBi
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Result 

After proper analysis, a dashboard was built by the team which cab be seen below:

</p>  <br> 

## Conclusion

It was found that most people who were absent most of the times had children, and the distance from the place of work also contributed to the increase in the number of absent staff. The social life of workers also contributed to the level of abenteeism. 

* Optimize Workload Distribution During Spring.
* Offer Support and Engagement for High Absenteeism Cases.
* Provide transport means to aid movement of workers or accomodation close to the workplace to make the workers easily available. 
* Encourage Responsible Drinking Practices.
* Enhance Support for Employees with Four Children, Including Childcare Options. <br>
